# Blue Bite Assessment

## Introduction

In this assessment you will create a front end web application that fetches Page entities from an API and renders them creating create a unique web page for each. In total there are three pages of increasing complexity and each are rendered using shared components. Pages when rendered should match the provided mockups. ([Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/9NtrKC7KAudIqARPU4OzfL/Front-End-Assessment?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=40%3A16&viewport=241%2C48%2C0.73&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=40%3A16&show-proto-sidebar=1)).

To get started a react project is included. TypeScript is recommended but you can alternatively use straight JavaScript. CSS modules are supported using the `.module.css` extension alternatively you can use any styling tooling/library you choose. Feel free to add other dependencies as
necessary.

### API

All responses return either a `data` property containing responses contents in the case of an `ok` response. Alternatively it may return an `error` property.

### GET /page/:id

Returns a description of the page. Containing several parts:

```
    {
        lists: Array<{
            id, // ID used to look up the list
            components, // Ordered list of component ids
        }>;
        components: Array<{
            id, // ID used to look up component
            type, // The type of the component (ex: `image`, `weather`)
            options, // An object with options specific to the component type
        }>;
        variables?: Array<{
            name, // Variable name
            type, // Variable type (ex: `string`)
            initialValue, // Value the variable starts at
        }> // optional not used on page-one. Should be page specific.
    }
```

### GET /integration/weather?lat=<lat>&lon=<lon>

Returns weather information for specific coordinates used in pages.

### Designs

We utilize [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) to manage design requests. Please create a free account and send us your email/username so we can grant you access


## Requirements

### Part 1
* Create image component
* Create weather component
* Render components on page

#### Notes
* Use the id (found in the pages path) via API to look up the Page entity mentioned in introduction.
* Cross referencing the Page entity and the mockups to create the `image` and `weather` components. The weather component will also require use of it's own API route described above in the introduction section.
* Using these components and the Page entity to render the page. You can assume the list with id 0 will always be the pages root.

#### Mockups
* [Part 1](https://app.zeplin.io/project/610d6d9d1936aa12f64a3a22/screen/612d1250e46281108433cf51)

### Part 2
* Create Button Component
* Create Condition Component
* Setup Variables

#### Notes
This page additionally includes variables, as well as 2 new components: button, and condition.

* Variables are set to their initial values when the page is loaded.
* Buttons when clicked change a variables current value.
* Conditions are components that render their `children` list when a specific variable is equal to the given value.

On completion this page will look like the mockups and the show and hide buttons should function.

#### Mockups
* [Part 2](https://app.zeplin.io/project/610d6d9d1936aa12f64a3a22/screen/612d1250a7910b16428c423f)

### Part 3
* Test previous work against a more complex page
* Fix any issues


#### Notes

This page has show and hide buttons as well as buttons which rotation through the different \
locations. There is no additional functionality but you should check your implementation against \
the more complex page configuration and resolve any issues. Again you can also check your \
implementation against the mockups.

## Submission
Upon completion of the assessment, please email your point of contact at Blue Bite a link to the repository.


## Local Setup

1. Clone repository into your GitHub account
2. Install Node version specified in `.nvmrc`
3. Use Yarn or NPM to install dependencies
4. Use 2 terminal sessions to start both the development server and the API via:
    a. `yarn run start` OR `npm run start`
    b. `yarn run start-server` OR `npm run start-server`
5. Follow steps in the `Requirements` section. Commit your work as needed.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn start-server`

Runs API by default this is hosted at http://localhost:3030

### `yarn test` (Usage optional)

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
